Sorry for lack of bells and whistles. Will get to that soon. Im just getting the functionality going. Should be presentable before I go out of town......<br><br>
So this is the Inventory manager. The way Im planning it is pretty simple and straightforward. If you want to add an item click on 'add item'. Then fill in necessary fields and click add. Same for the categories.<br><br>
Once all the items are entered and you want to see them in all their glory choose the category listing on the left. There will be an 'All Category' link so that if you want to see everything, sorted by the categories you can. I will have a dox link available soon. once I figure out the best way to explain everything. But like I said I am hoping for straightforward easy usage. So there might not be a need for DOX but I like to make them available just in case of brain farts....
