This is litterally a re-used CMS code base that I built in 2006. I have made a few minor changes since then to fit the need of inventory tracking. And since I work in an arcade my database names reflect that. Change the config files to match your database and you are up and running. It IS a little clunky at the moment but it works very well. The code is not up to current standards and that is one of the things I am wanting to do. The CSS needs a little work as well. This has been siting untouched for about 6 years now and Im trying to get my feet wet again before getting out in the tech comunity and looking even dumber than I actually am.

I am hoping to eventuall have this not only prettied up but also to automate the audit process and mail me once a week with anything that is at or below minimum levels. 

This is an attempt to finally upgrade this code to the latest standards and practices. Also a re intro to using git. Im floundering a bit
